            Welcome to transform report! To help us migrate to typescript, the transform tool is able to
            automate a lot of the repetitive work for us. However, we still have to do some work to complete
            the job.

            The purpose of this page is to display the remaining work for each file after the transform
            has been applied. In other words, we can see which files are easier to transform i.e. least errors vs
            more difficult/problematic to transform i.e a lot of errors.
        </p>

        <p class="bg-success">Green means great! The transform did all the work and you get a free ride!</p>
        <p class="bg-error">Red means the transform did most of the work but there are still issues to be manually
            fixed.</p>

        <p>
            This should give us a better understanding of how much work is left for migrating components, and
            which files to tackle next. We should tackle all the free ones asap to gain traction.
            Also note that these errors will decrease even further as the transform tool improves. For example,
            if the transform tool removes unused imports, then all no-unused-vars errors related to unused imports
            across all files will disappear.
        </p>

        <p>Happy transforming! Thank you for using transform.</p>
